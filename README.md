This project is adapted from the Kaggle 2014 competition [Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/Higgs-boson). The competition orgins from the famous Higgs Boson experiment and the competitors need to improve observation of Higgs Boson from background noise using machine learning methods. 

In this project, we are given train set data (including 250000 events, with an ID column, 30 feature columns, a weight column and a label column) and test set data (including 550000 events with an ID column and 30 feature columns). Only Numpy and visualization libraries are allowed. 

To reproduce our result one will need to:

1. Install Numpy on their computers;
2. Download train.csv and test.csv from kaggle;
3. Run the python scripy run.py.

Below we will introduce files and function in our repotory.
